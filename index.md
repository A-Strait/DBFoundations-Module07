# SQL Functions

## Introduction
Functions are somewhat more capable views. They can be created to return a table or single value, as opposed to the View’s limitation of table only returns. Parameters can used when creating functions, allowing you pass in arguments to return individualized results in real time. As a result, each function will always require ‘()’ syntax, even in instances where no parameters are passed. The below sections address when to use a user defined function (UDF) and the various subcategories you may come across.

## User Defined Functions
UDFs allow you to create your own custom functions to be called on within the same database as the creation. Relational Database Management Systems have countless pre-defined numeric, date, and string functions  *(W3 Schools, https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_sqlserver.asp, 2020)*, but there are limitations and if specific data manipulation is required, you will need a UDF. As a reminder, the Create Function statement must always be the first statement in a batch, requiring go just beforehand.

## Function Categories
Multiple subcategories of UDFs exist. Inline and Multi-Statement table valued functions can often complete similar tasks in different ways. See below for various syntactical differences.

### Scaler
Scalar functions always return a single value, and the schema must be included when identifying the function. Some existing examples include the aggregate functions:  SUM, MIN, MAX, COUNT, and AVG. 

### Inline Table Valued
A simple table-valued function that returns just a single set of rows. In this case, the attributes to display are determined in the Create Function statement at well as the definition of the parameter being used.

### Multi-Statement Table Valued
This sort of function can return results from multiple select statements in a single function, and as such is more involved when developing. The user defines a table variable in the Return block of the Create Function statement and by doing so, explicitly specifies the structure of the return table.

## Conclusion
Functions do have their limitations - When reporting data through analysis, it is important to note that Excel and other applications often cannot import information from database functions. Instead, you can wrap a UDF into a view and import the view into these applications OR simply utilize a View with Where clauses as required to mimic function parameters. The best scenario for function creation is if a less-experienced user wants to pull various data in real time for multiple variable parameters.
